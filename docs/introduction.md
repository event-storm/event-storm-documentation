**The Event Storm is a tiny store implementation with pure javascript.**
Event Storm will help to organize and manage your application's state. The library is designed to be framework and platform agnostics, which empowers an ability to use it, in **any Javascript runtime**.
:::info Reactjs binding
There is an official **[React wrapper](https://github.com/event-storm/react-event-storm)** of the Event Storm.

### When to use Event Storm?

- Large scale application with a lot of data consumers(1K+)
- The application is doing a lot of CPU intensive computations
- The bundle size limited applications(library size 2kb)
- Microservice applications(no matter using the same technology for microservices or not)

## Installation

To install the library run:

```bash
# npm
npm i event-storm

# yarn
yarn add event-storm
```

### Simple example

```typescript
import { createStorm } from 'event-storm';

const defaultState = {
  name: 'Event Storm',
  isActive: false,
}

const storm = createStorm(defaultState);

// subscribing to listen all the changes
storm.subscribe((state, access) => console.log(access(storm)));

// subscribing to listen only partial changes
storm.subscribe((state, access) => console.log(access(storm.name)));

// update the state
storm.dispatch({ name: 'Event Storm - manage your state effectively' });

// use previous state to make the updates
storm.dispatch(prev => ({ isActive: !prev.isActive }));
```
